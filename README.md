### What I learned

What I learned in this challenge is the manipulation of background using `svg`. Background properties doesn't have to be inserted in CSS as it will destroy the original design proposal of the challenge. It made me stuck for a while due to the placement of the `svg` itself.

```css
body {
    display:         flex;
    flex-direction:  column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items:     center;
    min-height:      100vh;
    text-rendering:  optimizeSpeed;
    line-height:     1.5;
    font-family: var(--font-family-redHatDisplay);
    background-color: var(--primary-color-300);
    background-image: url(images/pattern-background-mobile.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
}
```

```css
body {
        background-image: url(images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
        background-color: var(--primary-color-300);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-size: contain;
    }
```

As you can see, `background-repeat` and `background-size` was used to manipulate the position of the `svg`, It was enough to put the `svg` in the preferable postion.

At first I automatically used the `background-position: center` due to thinking that it will automatically put the `svg` in the preferred position, but that only destroyed the design proposal of the challenge.
